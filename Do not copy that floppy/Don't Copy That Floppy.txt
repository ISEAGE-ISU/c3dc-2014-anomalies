The North Korean Government has acquired the nuclear launch codes and has put them on floppy disks. The US Government wants these launch codes back. The Great Leader Kim Jong-Un has hidden the launch code disks among the Blue Teams to hide them from the United States government. If a blue team is caught by Government forces to be in possession of one of these floppy disks, that team will not be given points, while all of the other teams will receive points.  The Government will check throughout the day to see who among the blue teams is a traitor. Each time you are caught with a floppy you will lose 10 points and the total points you can lose is a max of 70.
